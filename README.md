If these don't work check out: https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/linux/software/python.md

In the python file you need to change lines 21, 27 to include your city and open weather API key ()

Also about half the code is from stack overflow and other some other opensource sources so thank you to all the people who made their code available to public domain.
